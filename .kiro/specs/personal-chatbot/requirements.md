# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This application is a standalone personal chatbot system built from scratch that enables persistent conversations with multiple selectable personas using OpenAI's API. The system maintains conversation memory and condenses chat history into significant details to preserve context while managing storage efficiently. Users can engage with different AI personas within the same conversation or across separate conversations, with full conversation history preserved across sessions. The application will be developed for WSL2 environment and use MariaDB database hosted on a Raspberry Pi for data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start and maintain persistent conversations with a chatbot, so that I can have ongoing dialogues that remember our previous interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user selects a persona THEN the system SHALL apply that persona's characteristics to all subsequent responses
3. WHEN a user wants to change personas mid-conversation THEN the system SHALL allow persona switching while maintaining conversation context
4. WHEN multiple personas are active in one conversation THEN the system SHALL clearly identify which persona is responding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to include multiple personas in a single conversation, so that I can have dynamic discussions with different AI personalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user wants to change intent mid-conversation THEN the system SHALL allow intent switching while maintaining conversation context
3. WHEN intent changes THEN the system SHALL adapt its response style and approach to match the new intent
4. WHEN multiple intents are present THEN the system SHALL clearly track and reference the current active intent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to remember important details from our conversations with comprehensive summarization, so that it can provide contextually relevant responses over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the total conversation history approaches the maximum context window or token limit THEN the system SHALL condense older parts of the conversation
2. WHEN summarizing conversations THEN the system SHALL use a clearly defined, reviewed, and tested prompt that preserves user goals, requests, unresolved questions, key facts, decisions, and user preferences
